# Scenariusz - GIT - EN

If you've build Proof of Concept of your idea - it's time to make a next step! My name is Marcin Lenkowski and I've been programming in technologies such as Laravel Symfony and Nest for over 12 years. In todays episode I'll tell you about team, motivation and version control system - GIT.

Of course, don't forget to subscribe, like and ring the bell, done? Let's get started!

If you are looking for validation of your idea in future team members, you will fall off faster than you started.

Before I started my programming career, I was very social media active. That's worked out for me, because I met Mark there. We've met on coffee, and he said that he want to create startup in funeral market... A strange business isn't it? Nevertheless, I wanted to do it, because of confidence with Marek words. It shows me, that he knew exactly what we need to do. His ambitious plan was so interesing to me, that i've made decision, without momennt hesitation. However, if he had told me that he wasn't sure about it, or hesitated for a moment.... He would never have sold me his idea. If you want to find the right team, they have to buy you first. At the initial stage, the team's task is not at all to prove the best technical solution, but to verify the market. It's good if we can do this quickly and update our product almost constantly. In our previous episode, we have created only Proof of Concent, if you haven't seen it yet, be sure to check it out soon!

We want to be able to make quick changes and manage the version. To do so, we will use version control system - GIT. It allows you to keep track in the project. Every modification, addition or deletion can be recorded, allowing you to easily find specific versions and go back to previous states.&#x20;

It also definitely facilitates teamwork. GIT allows multiple people to edit the same files simultaneously and then merge the changes in a consistent manner. This allows each team member to work on their task independently, and the system automatically integrates the changes made. The version control system also introduces security and data protection. We can see at a glance who made changes to our repository, and if there is a need to restore a previous version, it can be done with one simple command!

You can get Git for free, at git-scm.org. If you need remote repository, one of the biggest player on the market is github, we'll use that!

Now I'll show you how to add our POC to a GitHub repository. Here's what, let's go!

Git and GitHub has a lot of features beyond just holding code. You can create pull requests, perform code review use issues, and even deploy your code to server using github actions.

Now I'm going to show you how to deploy manually your application.&#x20;

Speaking of git and team, it's impossible to mention gitblame. Git allows you to find the author of a given line over time. Popular IDEs also allow us to display the author and date of changes, while writing code. There is one more thing.

That simple command allows you to check who is slacking on your project, and find more acitve team members!

If you want to be operate efficiently, GIT is already the industry standard. It not only speeds things up, but allows you to work smarter, more efficiently and smarter!

Today's episode, was rather simple, but extremely important. If you skip the GIT-related stage, you're already hindering your work on your startup from the start.

Would you like to build your project after hours? On Lenkowski.net you can find registration for workshops I'll be organizing soon. Be sure to check it out if you find something for you there!

And if you want more practical episodes about how to build a startup, be sure to leave a sub, a like and a bell. And we'll see you in the next episode, where we'll be building our startup. Ambitious? Such as you are!
